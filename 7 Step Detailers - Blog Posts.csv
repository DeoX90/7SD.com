Use a soft brush specifically made for cars if needed to remove stuck-on mud from wheel wells or tires. Additionally, use good quality pH balanced detergent free of caustic ingredients that could strip away wax protections previously applied as well as damage new finishes on paintwork such as clear coats etc.. Rinse all areas completely once done then dry using microfiber towels which help pick up more moisture than other materials would provide during drying time!</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Polishing to Restore Clarity and Brilliance</strong></h3><p id="""">Next comes polishing your car's finished exterior surfaces with an appropriate compound polish; these products contain abrasives that gently remove built up layers of oxidation while restoring clarity back into dulled paints no matter their age or condition without damaging them further!
